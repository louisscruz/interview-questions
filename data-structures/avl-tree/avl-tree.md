* min(node)
  * If a node is provided, find the min within that sub-tree.
* max(node)
  * If a node is provided, find the max within that sub-tree.
* depth(node)
  * If a node is provided, find the heigh of that sub-tree.
* breadth_first_traversal(node)
  * If a node is provided, perform breadth_first_traversal on that sub-tree.
* pre_order(node)
  * If a node is provided, perform pre_order on that sub-tree.
* in_order(node)
  * If a node is provided, perform in_order on that sub-tree.
* post_order(node)
  * If a node is provided, perform post_order on that sub-tree.
