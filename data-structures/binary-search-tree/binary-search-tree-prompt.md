# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is data structure where the each node has two children, where the value of the leftmost child is less than the parent and the value of the rightmost child is greater than the parent.

Construct a binary search tree with the following API:

* add(key)
* delete(key)
* search(key)
* min
* max
* pre_order
* in_order
* post_order
* breadth_first_traversal
