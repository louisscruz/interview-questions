# Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is data structure where the each node has two children, where the value of the leftmost child is less than the parent and the value of the rightmost child is greater than the parent.

Construct a binary search tree class with the following API:

* `insert` – adds a single node to the tree
* `delete` – removes a single node from the tree
* `search` – finds a node in the tree; return the node
* `min` – finds the node with the lowest value; return the node
* `max` – finds the node with the highest value; return the node
* `size` – traverses the tree to find the size
